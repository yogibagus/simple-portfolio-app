# Production Deployment Guide

## Security Checklist

### 1. Environment Variables
- [ ] Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in all values
- [ ] Generate a strong `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (minimum 32 characters)
- [ ] Use production MongoDB URI
- [ ] Set `NEXTAUTH_URL` to your production domain
- [ ] Configure `ALLOWED_EMAILS` with authorized admin emails

### 2. Security Headers
- [x] Content Security Policy (CSP) configured
- [x] X-Frame-Options set to DENY
- [x] X-Content-Type-Options set to nosniff
- [x] Strict-Transport-Security enabled
- [x] X-XSS-Protection enabled

### 3. Rate Limiting
- [x] API endpoints protected with rate limiting
- [x] Authentication endpoints have strict limits
- [x] Write operations have additional protection

### 4. Input Validation
- [x] All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- [x] URL validation for external links
- [x] String length limits enforced
- [x] Array size limits enforced

### 5. Authentication & Authorization
- [x] Google OAuth configured
- [x] Email-based access control
- [x] Session management with JWT
- [x] Protected admin routes

## Deployment Platforms

### Vercel (Recommended)
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy automatically on push to main branch

### Netlify
1. Build command: `npm run build`
2. Publish directory: `.next`
3. Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard

### Self-hosted
1. Build the application: `npm run build`
2. Start production server: `npm start`
3. Use PM2 for process management
4. Configure reverse proxy (Nginx/Apache)
5. Set up SSL certificate

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Image Optimization
- [x] Next.js Image component configured
- [x] WebP and AVIF formats enabled
- [x] External domains whitelisted

### 2. Compression
- [x] Gzip compression enabled
- [x] Static assets optimized

### 3. Caching
- Configure CDN for static assets
- Set appropriate cache headers
- Use Redis for session storage in production

## Monitoring & Logging

### 1. Error Tracking
- Set up Sentry or similar service
- Monitor API errors and performance

### 2. Analytics
- Add Google Analytics or similar
- Monitor user behavior and performance

### 3. Uptime Monitoring
- Use services like UptimeRobot
- Set up alerts for downtime

## Database Security

### 1. MongoDB Atlas
- Enable IP whitelisting
- Use strong authentication
- Enable encryption at rest
- Regular backups

### 2. Connection Security
- Use connection string with SSL
- Implement connection pooling
- Monitor connection limits

## Additional Security Measures

### 1. DDoS Protection
- Use Cloudflare or similar service
- Implement rate limiting at edge
- Monitor for suspicious traffic

### 2. Regular Updates
- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor security advisories
- Regular security audits

### 3. Backup Strategy
- Regular database backups
- Code repository backups
- Environment configuration backups

## Post-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Test all functionality in production
- [ ] Verify SSL certificate is working
- [ ] Check security headers with online tools
- [ ] Test rate limiting
- [ ] Verify admin access control
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Check performance with Lighthouse
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts

## Emergency Procedures

### 1. Security Incident
1. Immediately revoke compromised credentials
2. Check logs for suspicious activity
3. Update all secrets and keys
4. Notify users if necessary

### 2. Performance Issues
1. Check server resources
2. Review recent deployments
3. Scale resources if needed
4. Optimize database queries

### 3. Data Loss
1. Restore from latest backup
2. Check data integrity
3. Investigate root cause
4. Implement additional safeguards
